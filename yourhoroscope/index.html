<h1>YOUR 2015 BEAUTY HOROSCOPE</h1>

<br></br>

<h2>Capricorn</h2><h3>December 22 &ndash; January 19</h3>
<p>"2015 is much less about doing and more about attracting for this sign," says Edut. "This is a very spiritual year for Capricorn, but normally, they're the zodiac's most ambitious sign. They probably have a full wardrobe of businesswear. For 2015, Jupiter is in their eighth house, which is the sexiest part of the chart. Now's the time to work on refreshing that lingerie drawer and focus on wearing more black."</p><br>
<h2>Aquarius</h2><h3> January 20 &ndash; February 18</h3>
<p>"This is a very relationship-oriented year for Aquarius," says Edut. "They will go farther than they ever have in their partnerships. Their social lives will be very active, with a lot more time going out and a lot of nights on the town." This is good news, considering you're progressive types, who aim to shake things up and advance the world. Isn't it time you went forth boldly with your makeup, too?</p><br>
<h2>Pisces</h2><h3>February 19 &ndash; March 20</h3>
<p>In 2015, the dreamer of the zodiac will finally buckle down. "They will be paying their dues, but will see a lot of progress for their efforts — this is very much a year of career growth," Edut says. But, don't think this is all work and no play: "Jupiter will be in their house after August, so relationships will be big toward the end of the year."

What exactly does a fast-paced life mean for this creative type? "They want to come across as chic and professional," Edut says, "but they can't compromise on color. They should experiment with more muted hues, but still across the full spectrum."</p><br>

<h2>Aries</h2><h3>March 21 &ndash; April 19</h3>
<p>"This is the 'ta-da' year for Aries," Edut says. "Jupiter is in their fame house until August, and the moon is in their global ninth house for three years, so it's a big year for growth and a great romantic year. There could be a baby, a proposal, or the best dating spree they've had in a long time."</p><br>

<h2>Taurus</h2><h3>April 20 &ndash; May 20</h3>
<p>"Taurus will play more behind-the-scenes this year," Edut says. "They will be developing their best work in private or at home. But, it's going to be a really sexy year also — just in a slow-burning way." That doesn't mean shying away from moodier colors: "There's a very seductive energy, so choose darker hues, like jewel tones, silver, and black."</p><br>

<h2>Gemini</h2><h3>May 21 &ndash; June 21</h3>
<p>"In 2015, Geminis will finally be ready to commit to a serious relationship in ways they haven't in a long time," Edut says. "Plus, Jupiter is in their social house for the first nine months, so they're going to want to be out and about! Geminis tend to wear a lot of black, but this year they should gravitate toward brights, like pink and maybe some neon. They love contrast, so they could even try two bright, contrasting hues."</p><br>

<h2>Cancer</h2><h3>June 22 &ndash; July 22</h3>
<p>2015 also means that Cancer will be heading back to work in a big way. "Jupiter is in your sign, so there's new change and new opportunity to get into a routine," Edut says. "Plus, Saturn is in your healthy living and work house for three years, so you're going to be at the gym a lot more."

But, what's an off-duty Cancer to do? "You'll want to make your home a sanctuary, and a beautiful space to entertain," Edut adds, suggesting warm colors in earthy tones, pale pinks, and neutrals.</p><br>

<h2>Leo</h2><h3>July 23 &ndash; August 23</h3>
<p>"Jupiter is with this sign until August 11, so it's all about expansion. They are ready to let that freak flag fly," Edut says. (You heard the woman!) "It's all about making a bold splash — turning heads, but making sure they use that power to direct people to a cause they believe in." (Does lipstick count?) As for colors, you should be thinking winter whites, red, gold, and anything metallic. All eyes are on you.</p><br>

<h2>Virgo</h2><h3>August 23 &ndash; September 22</h3>
<p>"For Virgo, this is a year about letting go, healing, and preparing for Jupiter to finally arrive in August for a fresh start," Edut says. "Jupiter will arrive in their sign for the first time in over a decade, so it's kind of their big year — a launching time. This will be about taking time off, working from home, and going behind the scenes until the fall."

You can also do soul-searching in front of the mirror, but Edut insists on keeping things muted. "I see Virgo wandering around Bali in washed-out fabrics — think grays, and a dreamy state. They're preparing for a fresh start." </p><br>

<h2>Libra</h2><h3>September 23 &ndash; October 23</h3>
<p>"This is a very social year for Libra. Their popularity is definitely on the rise, but they need to be more selective about who they let into their circle," says Edut. "It's all about teamwork — collaborating, working in a group, and combining their talents." For colors, that means brights and metallics — futuristic elements. "Think cutting-edge, on-the-go, and being willing to really wear the wacky stuff."</p><br>

<h2>Scorpio</h2><h3>October 24 &ndash; November 21</h3>
<p>"Saturn, the taskmaster, has finally left this sign — it put them through boot camp, so they're stronger, faster, and ready to accomplish something big," Edut says. "This is a money-making year, for sure! There will be a lot of focus, but Scorpios should also allow themselves to enjoy the finer things. Have some VIP-room time and go high-end!"</p><br>

<h2>Sagittarius</h2><h3>November 22 &ndash; December 21</h3>
<p>"This sign is in cosmic boot camp — they get Saturn for three years. This means a lot of slow, steady growth and cleaning house: putting in new structures, and letting go of things that just don't work anymore," Edut says. "This is new, because Sags can be very 'live for the moment!' Still, you'll be traveling a lot in the first eight months of the year, because there's a desire to do things that are enterprising. This is a time to upgrade, learn discipline and open-mindedness, and be a bit more practical."</p><br>
