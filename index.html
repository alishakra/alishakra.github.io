		Elegance, charm, sophistication and confidence best define a Libran woman. She is a complete woman who attracts people not only with her charming manners and delightful elegance but with her arguments as well. Libran woman are great talkers but that does not mean that they do not listen. In fact, they are efficient listeners and would patiently listen to your monologue. Librans are lovers of luxuries and hate to be in shabby surroundings. They have an eye for extravagance and love to pamper and indulge themselves.</p>
